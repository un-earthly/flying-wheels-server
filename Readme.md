This applcation uses [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) which is a framework for Nodejs.[cros](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) is used for accessing data from the frontend.As for the database i've used [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/), Which is non sql database.to ensure data access i've used [jwt](https://jwt.io/). When a users log in with their credentials a token is given to them and based on that it verifies and provides data to the user. to handle the payments using credit card i've used stripe.to ensure credentials arent reaveld, they were secured using dotenv. used javascript esnext features to make the application up n running.ðŸ˜Š
